Hello!

Really enjoyed this test, was fun to work on and to write tests for. Feel like my style of writing improved of the course of it which is to be expected.

All code is fairly well tested, but questions one probably could be refactored as they share similar functionality which could be done more flexibly and less repetitive.  

Most imprortant thing to get it production ready was the testing. But with more time I would 
- make the arguments type specific 
- include docstrings and try and reduce one_a and one_b to one file as they are quite similar and would be consistent with problem 2's implementation
- add functionality to make the code runnable as a cli tool.
- rearrange directory structure


Only code untested is the reading file functionality, which would would definitely improve the security and robustness of the code.

Thanks for a taking a look!

Alex.
